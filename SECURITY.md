## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilites to Moritz.Hedtke@t-online.de.

You can expect me to respond within a few days but please be patient if it takes longer.

Please provide as much details as you can. If you have one a proof of concept would be great.

If you report a valid vulnerability you can get a place in the (currently nonexistent) Hall of Fame.
There may be a possibility for a bug bounty but I can't guarantee that.

You can write in English or German.
